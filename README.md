# Kipify

Kipify was developed as an open source app which recommends you new songs on Spotify.
It started as a final project for Harvard's CS50 Final Project. It aims to help out
people trying to find new music to listen to or to find music similar to what they
already listen to.

It was made open source, because well I don't really see any way to make profit,
plus I myself wouldn't pay for a service like this.

### Motivation

I needed something for the [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) final project.

#### Github Branching and Tags

It's all completely messed, gonna create a new repository in the future and archive this one.
