# Kipify

Kipify was developed as an open source app which recommends you new songs on Spotify.
It makes a playlist of 50 songs, based on your data from the past, while making sure
to not include songs which you have added to your liked songs.

## Motivation

I needed something for the [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) final project.
